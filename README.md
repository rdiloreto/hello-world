# hello-world
hello, world!, I'm on github now

I am a graduate student and bioinformaticist in the Tri-I Computational Biology & Medicine program at Cornell. I'm interested in using bioinformatic analysis of sequencing data to better understand the regulation of gene networks and to optimize treatments through the use of personal genomic data.
